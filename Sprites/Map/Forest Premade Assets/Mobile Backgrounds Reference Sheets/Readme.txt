The Mobile Backgrounds consists of 8 pre-made backgrounds, each with 7 layers of parallax.

The numbers refer to the background and layer. For example, the image 01_2 is refering to the layer 2 of the background 01.
There's only a few exceptions:
-Backgrounds 02, 03 and 04 doesn't have an image for the layer 5, in these backgrounds the layer 6 image is meant to be the 01_6 
-Backgrounds 06, 07 and 08 doesn't have an image for the layer 5, in these backgrounds the layer 5 image is meant to be the 05_5

Backgrounds 1 to 4 are forest sceneries. From 5 to 8 are open landscapes.

The layers for the forest sceneries tile seamlessly between each other, so you don't have to worry about following the exact suggestions of the reference sheet. The layers can be mixed and matched and i encourage creators to do so. These references are just suggestions.
The same applies for the open landscapes layers.
